    abstract = {Genomic sequencing has made it clear that a large fraction of
                the genes specifying the core biological functions are shared by
                all eukaryotes. Knowledge of the biological role of such shared
                proteins in one organism can often be transferred to other
                organisms. The goal of the Gene Ontology Consortium is to produce
                a dynamic, controlled vocabulary that can be applied to all
                eukaryotes even as knowledge of gene and protein roles in cells
                is accumulating and changing. To this end, three independent
                ontologies accessible on the World-Wide Web
                (http://www.geneontology.org) are being constructed: biological
                process, molecular function and cellular component.},

    abstract = {Gene set enrichment analysis is a widely used tool for analyzing
                gene expression data. However, current implementations are slow
                due to a large number of required samples for the analysis to
                have a good statistical power. In this paper we present a novel
                algorithm, that efficiently reuses one sample multiple times and
                thus speeds up the analysis. We show that it is possible to make
                hundreds of thousands permutations in a few minutes, which leads
                to very accurate p-values. This, in turn, allows applying
                standard FDR correction procedures, which are more accurate than
                the ones currently used. The method is implemented in a form of
                an R package and is freely available at

                analysis tool that supports various evidence types, identifier
                types and organisms. The toolset integrates many databases,
                including Gene Ontology, KEGG and TRANSFAC, to provide a
                comprehensive and in-depth analysis of gene lists. It also
                provides interactive and intuitive user interfaces and supports
                ordered queries and custom statistical backgrounds, among other
                settings. g:Profiler provides multiple programmatic interfaces to
                access its functionality. These can be easily integrated into
                custom workflows and external tools, making them valuable
                resources for researchers who want to develop their own
                solutions. g:Profiler has been available since 2007 and is used
                to analyse millions of queries. Research reproducibility and
                transparency are achieved by maintaining working versions of all
                past database releases since 2015. g:Profiler supports 849
                species, including vertebrates, plants, fungi, insects and
                parasites, and can analyse any organism through user-uploaded
                custom annotation files. In this update article, we introduce a
                novel filtering method highlighting Gene Ontology driver terms,
                accompanied by new graph visualizations providing a broader
                context for significant Gene Ontology terms. As a leading
                enrichment analysis and gene list interoperability service,
                g:Profiler offers a valuable resource for genetics, biology and

                tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from
                such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a
                powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
                (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives
                its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that
                share common biological function, chromosomal location, or
                regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several
                cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer.
                Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity
                between two independent studies of patient survival in lung
                cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA
                method is embodied in a freely available software package,
                together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined
                gene sets.},

The gene-annotation enrichment analysis is a promising high-throughput strategy that increases the likelihood for investigators to identify biological processes most pertinent to their study. Approximately 68 bioinformatics enrichment tools that are currently available in the community are collected in this survey. Tools are uniquely categorized into three major classes, according to their underlying enrichment algorithms. The comprehensive collections, unique tool classifications and associated questions/issues will provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date view regarding the advantages, pitfalls and recent trends in a simpler tool-class level rather than by a tool-by-tool approach. Thus, the survey will help tool designers/developers and experienced end users understand the underlying algorithms and pertinent details of particular tool categories/tools, enabling them to make the best choices for their particular research interests.},
